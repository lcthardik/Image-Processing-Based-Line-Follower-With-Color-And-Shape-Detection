# Image-Processing-Based-Line-Follower-With-Color-And-Shape-Detection
### Description:
This project is based on a Line Following Robot. Instead of traditional sensors, it utilizes image processing through OpenCV to follow a black line. The robot is also equipped with the ability to detect shapes on the track, along with identifying the color of those shapes. This robot was developed for a competition in the year 2018. 

### The major components used were:
* Raspberry Pi 3 
* PiCam
* Encoder DC Motors
* Motor Driver
